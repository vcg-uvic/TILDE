We obtained the binaries from
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/detectors.html#binaries

The original package  also provides binaries for windows,  but we here
include only the binaries for linux machines. For more details, please
refer to the above website.


This package contains statically linked Linux binary and Windows executable of 
Maximum Stable Extremal Regions detector.

Usage: extrema [options]

    -i (null)    [null] input image (png, tiff, jpg, ppm, pgm)
    -o (null)    [null] output file
    -per (0.010) [0.010] maximum relative area
    -es (1.000)  [1.000] ellipse scale, (output types 2 and 4)
    -ms (30)     [30] minimum size of output region
    -mm (10)     [10] minimum margin
    -rel (0)     [0] use relative margins
    -t (0)       [0] output file type 
                      0 - RLE
                      1 - Extended boundary
                      2 - Ellipse
Dependencies:

    Option -i is compulsory

Detected MSER+ and MSER- regions are stored in output file as follows:


Extrema file format RLE:

NUM_MSER_PLUS
NUM_RLE LINE COL1 COL2 LINE COL1 COL2 ... LINE COL1 COL2
...
NUM_RLE LINE COL1 COL2 LINE COL1 COL2 ... LINE COL1 COL2
NUM_MSER_MINUS
NUM_RLE LINE COL1 COL2 LINE COL1 COL2 ... LINE COL1 COL2
...
NUM_RLE LINE COL1 COL2 LINE COL1 COL2 ... LINE COL1 COL2

where NUM_MSER_PLUS and NUM_MSER_MINUS are number of MSER+ and MSER- regions 
respectively. Each region is described as one line in output file. 
NUM_RLE specifies number of RLE triples LINE COL1 COL2.


Extrema file format Extended boundary:

NUM_MSER_PLUS
NUM_PTS X Y X Y ... X Y
...
NUM_PTS X Y X Y ... X Y
NUM_MSER_MINUS
NUM_PTS X Y X Y ... X Y
...
NUM_PTS X Y X Y ... X Y

where NUM_MSER_PLUS and NUM_MSER_MINUS are number of MSER+ and MSER- regions 
respectively. Each region is described as one line in output file. NUM_PTS 
specifies number of points in extended boundary.


Extrema file format Ellipse:

1.0
NUM_TOTAL_MSER
U V A B C 
...
U V A B C

where NUM_TOTAL_MSER is number of MSER+ and MSER- regions. Each region is 
described as one line in output file. Each affine region is described as an 
ellipse with parameters U,V,A,B,C in:
 
a(x-u)(x-u)+2b(x-u)(y-v)+c(y-v)(y-v)=1

with (0,0) at image top left corner.
